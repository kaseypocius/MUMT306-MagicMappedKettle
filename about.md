<h1> Why? </h1>
The combination of Water & Live electronics has interested me throughout my undergraduate studies, and has often resulted in well received & memorable performances, such as the CLOrk performances at the  <a href="https://vimeo.com/303592192"> MINT conference 2018</a> & <a href="http://festivaldelaimagen.com/"> Festival Internacional De La Imagen 2019</a>.

Throughout my studies I have had the pleasure of studying with <a href="github.com/navid"> Navid Navab</a> & <a href="https://github.com/petervanhaaften"> Peter Van Haaften</a> both of whom have worked on <a href="http://navidnavab.net/projects.html#aquaphoneia"> Aquaphonia</a>, an installation work which has been incredibly formative to how I work with mappings. I was interested in working with the concepts raised in Aquaphonia of natural, everyday processes controlling electronic processing of sounds captured in the presentation space, but I wanted the interactive interface to be portable, with the ability to be played like a percussion instrument as seen with the fountain used in the CLOrk performances. Having used a piezo inside of a coffee cup for my performance work with the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVAag53U51Q"> Writer's </a><a href="https://github.com/olivercarter/WritersBlock"> Block</a> project, I was inspired to continue on the kitchen theme and decided build an electronically enhanced kettle, which I hope to expand into a family of electronically enhanced kitchen appliances for use in performance or installation environments.
